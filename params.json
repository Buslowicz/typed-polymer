  "body": "# Typed Polymer\r\nTypedPolymer is a TypeScript based Polymer components framework. It was inspired by [PolymerTS](https://github.com/nippur72/PolymerTS), the concept was a bit different though. Instead of only using Polymer features and base it on HTML5 imports, my concept was to create a JS/TS import structure and add features I've personally been missing in Polymer.\r\n\r\nThis is how the Typed Polymer was born. It is still in alpha stage and is definitely **NOT** production ready. I will, however, invest some time in building it to perfection and killing any bugs that arise.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Typed Polymer embraces the power of [Decorators](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/blob/master/pages/Decorators.md) in order to work. If you cannot use them by any reason, please do not use this library.\r\n\r\n**Note2:** Typed Polymer does **NOT** support legacy browsers, and will never ever do (unless I get paid millions).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nBesides of default Polymer features, Typed Polymer introduces:\r\n\r\n* Component name (tag name) is by default taken from a class name (can be overridden)\r\n* [**JS expressions**](https://github.com/Draccoz/typed-polymer/wiki/expression-binding) in template bindings\r\n* [**targeted events**](https://github.com/Draccoz/typed-polymer/wiki/targeted-events) with a css selector filter (just like _.on()_ in jQuery)\r\n* [**once**](https://github.com/Draccoz/typed-polymer/wiki/once-events) events\r\n* [styles and template](https://github.com/Draccoz/typed-polymer/wiki/decorators) provided in decorators (which is also available in PolymerTS)\r\n\r\n## Docs\r\n* [Creating an element](https://github.com/Draccoz/typed-polymer/wiki/creating-elements)\r\n* [Decorators](https://github.com/Draccoz/typed-polymer/wiki/decorators)\r\n* [Examples](https://github.com/Draccoz/typed-polymer/wiki/examples)\r\n",
